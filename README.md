> ### Simple. Fault-tolerant. Distributed.
> A web framework.

## Getting started

Start by add the rebar3 template for Nova.

*Via curl*
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/novaframework/nova/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

*Via wget*
```bash
sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/novaframework/nova/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

After this is done use rebar3 to generate a new project with Nova.

```bash
rebar3 new nova my_first_nova
```

We will add a homepage soon.

## Documentation

## Contributing

Contribution is welcome to Nova. Check our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more information. We will add features and bugs in the issues list.

### Generating a Nova project

Start a new project with:

```bash
rebar3 new nova my_first_nova
```

That will generate a Nova project for you.

```bash
rebar3 shell
```

This will fetch all dependencies and compile. After compilation it will start a shell that also say what port it is running on and some debug lines.

When the shell is started, open a browser and go to localhost:8080 and it will point to the my_first_nova server running Nova.
